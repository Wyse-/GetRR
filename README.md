## Description
This is a simple program written in C and compiled using Code::Blocks 16.01 and GCC. It will read your monitor's refresh rate and write it to refreshRate.txt in the exe's directory. If you have multiple monitors it will will read the main moitor's refresh rate. I personally use paired with a Rainmeter skin which warns me when I start a game (Overwatch in my case) with a low refresh rate.

## Rainmeter skin config
You will have to edit the rainmeter skin's Url and ProcessName lines, the first one has to be the path to the txt file preceded by file://, and the second one has to be the game's process name.
